# Jam.NET

Jam.NET is a free software client that reimplements the functionality of the abandoned app "Jammit".

For bleeding-edge testing, you can download builds from [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/maxton/jam-net/build/artifacts).

More stable builds will be released periodically in [the releases tab](https://github.com/maxton/Jam.NET/releases).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.
For code style, please note that this project uses the default C# code style, but with 2 spaces instead of tabs.
PRs not adhering to the style will not be merged.
